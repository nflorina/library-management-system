 # Here you can choose one of these options:
 1. **New Student** - enrole yourself as a student in the library system
 2. **New Book** - register a new entry as a book in the library system
 3. **Statistics** - evaluate the number of books, students and issue and have a full perspective of teh state of library
 4. **New Issue** - search and select a new book; to automate the process they simply need to enter the number of issues and the Issue     ID for each book issue would generate automatically
 5. **Return book** - the most important feature for any library is to issue and return books. A panel to view all outstanding logs and   a super simple panel to issue and return books for all librarians
 6. **About** - some infos about me
